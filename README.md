euler-scala
===========

Learning scala through project euler (http://projecteuler.net).

With the exception of extending trait, `Problem`, each problem implementation
is self-contained. This is intentional because it forced the reimplementation
of common mathematical functions such as `isPrime` and `isPandigital`.
